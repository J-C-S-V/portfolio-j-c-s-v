            I&apos;m a music teacher who developed an interest in coding after
            seeing the positive impact it can have on others. I grew up around
            computers and had to choose between studying music or systems
            engineering, ultimately choosing music. ðŸŽ¼

            I completed a 5-year music program and taught in schools for 3
