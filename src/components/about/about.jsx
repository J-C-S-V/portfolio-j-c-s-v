            I'm a music teacher who developed an interest in coding after seeing
            the positive impact it can have on others. I grew up around
            computers and had to choose between studying music or systems
            engineering, ultimately choosing music. ðŸŽ¼

            I completed a 5-year music program and taught in schools for 3
            years, but now I want to switch careers to become a successful web
            developer. ðŸ’»
